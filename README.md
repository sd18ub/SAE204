Hello,
This is a project formy university.
First step to have the file is to download the files : 

  - You can use "git clone ...."
  - Or download

Second step is to update dependence. It's jfreechart. The files are directly inside the projet. You just need to unzip the directory and add to your project on Intelij the file called "jfreechart-1.0.19-demo.jar"

If you don't know how to add a dependence on Intelij : 
Go top left>> New projects setup >> Librairies >> click on "+"  and go to the unziped directory jfreechart.zip and add "jfreechart-1.0.19-demo.jar" only
